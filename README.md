# DTMF-Controlled-Robo-Car
This project designs a telerover system wirelessly controlled via DTMF signals from a mobile keypad. The rover decodes button tones to move forward, backward, left, or right, using a DTMF decoder, microcontroller, and motor driver. It operates over cellular voice channels, independent of internet access, ensuring long-range control.
